Adjust the power strip to toggle on/off every 12 hours. This will create the day/night cycle.

Configure the humidistat to turn on at 70% and off at 85% to create the regulated climate for your mushrooms.

Configure the thermostat controller to turn on/off somewhere between 55-65F degrees. For the space my tent is in, I found it fair to have it maintain ~60F degrees. If I had a more powerful heater, I might dial it in more, but I'm really relying on the ambient temperature to be relatively stable. Again, this is *not* an outdoor build.

Fill the humidifier tote with a few inches of water; At least enough for the ultrasonic humidifier ring to float. Also make sure the mist maker isn't shooting water into the fan.

## Operation

Operations is pretty simple for this unit. Ensure that the humidifier doesn't run dry, and that is about it. The system will continuously regulate the humidity/temperature/FAE balance, and all you have to do is wait!
