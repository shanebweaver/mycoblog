## Maintenance + Cleaning

### Grow chamber
As with all setups, there needs to be some level of cleanup every few weeks. Simply wipe down the tent components with 70% isopropyl alchohol, and difficult to reach areas can be hit with a spray:

- Tent plastic
- Tent frame + racks
- Base tray
- Perlite tray
- Intake/output flanges

### Humidifier
The humidifier components also need regular cleaning to prevent mold growth from the extra moisture. Simply wipe down with 70% isopropyl alchohol, and difficult to reach areas can be hit with a spray:

- Plastic tote + lid
- Mist output (PVC + tubing)
- Air intake fan

#### Ultrasonic humidifier head

The ultrasonic disks should be replaced every few weeks, to remove any mineral or other buildup an dkeep performance high. Always make sure to unplug the unit first and allow time to cool; the unit may be warm to the touch, and touching the discs when they are working can give quite a zap. 

Start by giving the ultrasonic head a soak in vinegar for a few hours (or overnight) to loosen up any deposits. Then allow the unit to dry. Any moisture under the ceramic disks can shorten the lifespan and reduce mist output. Wipe it out with a paper towel to speed up the drying process.

Using a disk key (provided with each pack of disks) unscrew the disk retaining rings and then remove the disks. Then insert new disks, screw the retaining rings back on, and plop it back in the humidifier tote.
