# Hi,

I'm Shane Weaver; Engineer and entrepreneur.

Born and raised in the Puget Sound region of Washington State; I spend my free time wood working, studying amateur mycology, [coding](https://github.com/shweaver-MSFT), sweating to [Beat Saber](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQncYd_cub1LFv9zl7KRfvPA2fVM1Lfq_), and hanging with the family 🤹‍️

The thoughts and views expressed on this site are my own. They do not represent the opinions of my employer in any way.

Mush love,

## Shane 🍄
